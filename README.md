A Deep Dive into Spotify Data (2023-2024) 🎧📊

I am excited to share my latest data analytics project, where I transformed raw Spotify data into actionable insights using Power BI. The goal was to understand popularity drivers, artist performance, and content trends over the past two years.


🛠️ Project Workflow: From Data to Dashboard

Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured a dataset containing 788 songs and 342 unique artists.


Advanced DAX Modeling: Developed custom measures to extract deep insights:

Average Popularity: Calculated a global benchmark of 89.62.


Performance Metrics: Created measures for "Sum of Popularity" and "Avg Duration" (3.28 min) to compare artist impact.


Visualization Strategy: Designed an interactive UI to make complex data easy to digest.
🔍 Visual Analysis: What the Charts Tell Us
To build a comprehensive story, I used specific visualizations, each serving a unique analytical purpose:
KPI Summary Cards:

Value: Displayed total songs, artists, and average duration.
Analytical Use: Provides an immediate snapshot of the dataset's scale before deep-diving into specifics.


Bar Charts (Artist & Song Rankings):

Value: Ranked artists like Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and Billie Eilish by their popularity scores.
Analytical Use: Identifies "Market Leaders." For instance, while some artists have more tracks, others like Billie Eilish maintain a higher average popularity (92.15).

Donut Charts (Content Segmentation):

Value: Analyzed songs by Album Type (562 Albums vs. 268 Singles) and Explicitness.
Analytical Use: Helps understand content strategy. We see a preference for non-explicit content (443 songs) which often correlates with broader commercial reach.

Trend Lines (Temporal Analysis):

Value: Tracked the volume of songs from 2023 (423) to 2024 (452).
Analytical Use: Crucial for spotting growth trends and seasonal release patterns across different months.


Detailed Data Tables (Top Hits):

Value: Listed top-performing tracks like "Beautiful Things" and "Die With A Smile" with perfect 100.00 popularity scores.
Analytical Use: Allows for "Micro-Analysis" to see which specific tracks are driving an artist's overall success.


📈 Key Takeaways

Taylor Swift dominates in volume with 1,854 tracks and 83 albums in the analyzed set.

The year 2024 saw a significant increase in song output compared to 2023.


Singles are a powerful tool for reaching peak popularity (100/100) compared to full album tracks.

This project sharpened my skills in Data Storytelling, DAX logic, and Dashboard Design. I'm looking forward to applying these insights to more complex datasets!
